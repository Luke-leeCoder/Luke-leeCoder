## About Me
I'm a passionate .NET developer and tech enthusiast with a keen interest in cross-platform UI frameworks and tools like **Avalonia** and **MAUI**. My focus is on creating modern, responsive UIs within the .NET ecosystem.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- **Languages**: C#, JavaScript
- **Frameworks**: .NET, WPF, Avalonia UI, MAUI, React

## 📖 My Blog
On my blog, [lukewire129](https://lukewire129.github.io/blog/), I write about .NET, Avalonia, UI styling, and useful tips for developers. If you're interested in Avalonia, Markdown-based blogging, or .NET internals, you’ll find valuable insights there.

## 📂 Web Front Showcase: Avalonia Styling Project
I transferred my WPF-based styling work to **Avalonia** and implemented it as a web front page, aiming to achieve consistent design across platforms. You can check it out directly on the [web front page](https://delightful-profiterole-0fa25d.netlify.app/).

#### Project Summary
- **Goal**: To transfer WPF styling to Avalonia and provide a consistent UI/UX experience in a web environment.
- **Tech Stack**: Avalonia, .NET, WebAssembly
- **Main Features**:
  - Styling with cross-platform compatibility in mind
  - Consistent UI component arrangement and responsive design
  - Performance optimization for the web environment

#### Topics Covered
- **UI/UX Design**: Flexible UI design that adapts to various devices
- **Cross-Platform Implementation**: Providing a unified experience across web and desktop using Avalonia and WebAssembly
- **Open-Source Contribution Potential**: This project can serve as a reference for other developers starting with styling in Avalonia.
